DxSter, the Alzheimer's Algorithmic Diagnostic Helper.

The DxSter module takes a Clincal diagnosis (PhyDx) and the Neurophyscological diagnosis (NpDx) to output the algorithmic diagnosis (AlgDx). The idea is that the AlgDx saves time to formulate a diagnosis of an ALZ patient but reducing the need for consensus conferences.
